As the integration of Artificial Intelligence into daily decision-making processes intensifies, the need for clear communication between humans and AI systems becomes crucial. The Adaptive XAI (AXAI) workshop focuses on the design and development of intelligent interfaces that can adaptively explain AI's decision-making processes and our engagement with those processes.

In line with the human-centric principles of the <a href="https://future-ai-research.it/spoke1/">Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) project</a>, this workshop seeks to explore, understand and develop interfaces that dynamically adapt, thereby creating explanations of AI-based systems that both relate to and resonate with a range of users with different explanation-based requirements. As AI's role in our lives becomes ever more embedded, the ways in which such systems explain elements about the system need to be malleable and responsive to the ever-evolving individual's cognitive state, relating to contextual needs/focus and to the social setting.

For instance, easy to use and effective interaction modalities like Visual Languages can provide users with intuitive mechanisms to interact with, adjust, and reshape AI narratives. This ensures that a richer, more tailored understanding can be provided, allowing explanations to emerge in line with the users' demands and the ever-shifting contexts they find themselves in, both as individuals and as part of a group.

The Adaptive XAI workshop extends an invitation to scholars, designers, and technologists to collaboratively shape the future of human-XAI interplay.

<h2 id="topics" class="tdbc-h3">Topics and Themes</h2>

This year's workshop will delve deeper into emerging trends and challenges identified during our <a href="/2024/">first edition</a>, with a particular focus on:

1. Advancements in **personalized XAI interfaces** that adapt to users' evolving needs and contexts
2. Novel **interaction modalities for XAI**, including multimodal and immersive explanations
3. **Ethical considerations** in adaptive XAI, addressing issues of transparency, trust, and user autonomy
4. Integration of **XAI in specific domains**, such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems
5. Evaluation methodologies for **adaptive XAI interfaces**
6. **Over-reliance and automation bias in XAI systems**, exploring strategies to maintain appropriate user skepticism and engagement
7. Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing explainability**, including their potential and limitations in generating human-understandable explanations
8. **Interactive Machine Learning** approaches in XAI, focusing on user-in-the-loop systems that allow for real-time adjustments and explanations
9. **Hybrid decision-making frameworks** that effectively combine human expertise with AI capabilities, supported by adaptive explanations
