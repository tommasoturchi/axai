As the integration of Artificial Intelligence into daily decision-making processes intensifies, the need for clear communication between humans and AI systems becomes crucial. The Adaptive XAI (AXAI) workshop focuses on the design and development of intelligent interfaces that can adaptively explain AI's decision-making processes and our engagement with those processes.

In line with the human-centric principles of the [Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) project](https://future-ai-research.it/spoke1/), this workshop seeks to explore, understand and develop interfaces that dynamically adapt, thereby creating explanations of AI-based systems that both relate to and resonate with a range of users with different explanation-based requirements. As AI's role in our lives becomes ever more embedded, the ways in which such systems explain elements about the system need to be malleable and responsive to the ever-evolving individual's cognitive state, relating to contextual needs/focus and to the social setting.

For instance, easy to use and effective interaction modalities like Visual Languages can provide users with intuitive mechanisms to interact with, adjust, and reshape AI narratives. This ensures that a richer, more tailored understanding can be provided, allowing explanations to emerge in line with the users' demands and the ever-shifting contexts they find themselves in, both as individuals and as part of a group.

The Adaptive XAI workshop extends an invitation to scholars, designers, and tech-nologists to collaboratively shape the future of human-XAI interplay.

### Topics and Themes

In an era where AI-driven decisions deeply influence many human activities, the importance of understanding the rationale behind these decisions has been emphasized by numerous studies.

The Adaptive XAI workshop emerges as a pivotal avenue to address this need. Situated at the intersection of algorithmic complexity and human-centric design, a space that has seen considerable interest in recent years, the workshop aims to conceptualize adaptive interfaces that explain AI's decision-making processes. The focus extends beyond mere explanations, placing emphasis on their adaptability to people preferences and styles, as well as their cognitive needs of understanding and of situational awareness, a concept highlighted in previous HCI research.

This workshop's theme dovetails with the foundational principles of the ACM IUI 2024. The very essence of IUI, as underlined in past conferences and discussions, is the seamless integration of AI's computational capabilities with the imperatives of HCI. As AI's role in user-centric applications intensifies, the challenge is not just about harnessing its intelligence, but ensuring this intelligence is made palpable and actionable for users with diverse needs. Through this lens, the Adaptive XAI workshop stands poised to make significant contributions to the evolving discourse at the heart of IUI. The convergence of AI and HCI, a topic of continued interest and exploration, embodies the spirit of the IUI conference.

The Adaptive XAI workshop, with its focus on intelligent interfaces for tailored AI explanations, provides a contemporary take on this intersection.

### Organisers

**Tommaso Turchi** is an Assistant Professor at the University of Pisa (Italy). His research focuses on Human-Centered AI and End-User Development. He has worked on various research projects related to the interaction with AI systems and is currently investigating the use of Design Fiction for AI-as-a-service applications in the medical field. His most recent work includes the development of a co-design toolkit to identify and address bias in ML-based collaborative decision-making domains.

**Alessio Malizia** is an Associate Professor at the University of Pisa (Italy). His research explores the convergence of physical and digital realms, aiming to enhance interactive system design.

**Fabio Paternò** is Research Director at CNR-ISTI in Pisa (Italy). His research activity has mainly been carried out in the HCI field, with the goal to introduce computational support to improve usability, accessibility, and user experience for all in the various possible contexts of use by proposing relevant languages, models, design spaces, tools, and applications.

**Simone Borsci** is an Associate Professor of Human Factors and Cognitive Ergonomics at the University of Twente (Netherlands). His research spans across Human factors and ergonomics, interaction with technology and artefacts, usability and accessibility studies, and user ex- perience analysis in ubiquitous computing contexts.

**Alan Chamberlain** is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham (United Kingdom). His research is based on Human-Computer Interaction, Ethnography, Action Research, Participatory Design, and User Engagement in order to develop networks of people who are able to involve themselves in the practices of innovation and design.
