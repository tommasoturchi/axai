As the integration of Artificial Intelligence into daily decision-making processes intensifies, the need for clear communication between humans and AI systems becomes crucial. The Adaptive XAI (AXAI) workshop focuses on the design and development of intelligent interfaces that can adaptively explain AI's decision-making processes and our engagement with those processes.

In line with the human-centric principles of the [Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) project](https://future-ai-research.it/spoke1/), this workshop seeks to explore, understand and develop interfaces that dynamically adapt, thereby creating explanations of AI-based systems that both relate to and resonate with a range of users with different explanation-based requirements. As AI's role in our lives becomes ever more embedded, the ways in which such systems explain elements about the system need to be malleable and responsive to the ever-evolving individual's cognitive state, relating to contextual needs/focus and to the social setting.

For instance, easy to use and effective interaction modalities like Visual Languages can provide users with intuitive mechanisms to interact with, adjust, and reshape AI narratives. This ensures that a richer, more tailored understanding can be provided, allowing explanations to emerge in line with the users' demands and the ever-shifting contexts they find themselves in, both as individuals and as part of a group.

The Adaptive XAI workshop extends an invitation to scholars, designers, and technologists to collaboratively shape the future of human-XAI interplay.

### Topics and Themes

The topics include <u>but are not limited to</u>:

1. **Understanding AI Decisions**: Exploring methods and technologies for making AI decision-making processes transparent and comprehensible to users.
2. **Human-Centric AI Design**: Focusing on the design of AI systems that prioritize human needs, preferences, and cognitive abilities in the context of understanding AI behavior.
3. **Adaptive Explanation Interfaces**: Developing interfaces that can adapt their explanatory content to suit different user needs, learning styles, and situational contexts.
4. **Cognitive Needs and Situational Awareness**: Addressing how AI explanations can cater to the cognitive needs of users and enhance their situational awareness in various domains.
5. **Seamless AI-HCI Integration**: Discussing strategies for integrating AI capabilities with human-computer interaction in a way that is intuitive and beneficial for users.
6. **Diversity and Inclusivity in AI Explanations**: Considering how AI explanations can be made accessible and useful for a diverse range of users with varying backgrounds and abilities.
7. **Ethical Considerations in AI Explanations**: Delving into the ethical implications of AI explanations, including issues of transparency, accountability, and bias.
8. **Case Studies and Real-World Applications**: Presenting case studies or real-world examples where adaptive AI explanations have been effectively implemented.
9. **Future Directions in Adaptive XAI**: Exploring emerging trends, potential challenges, and future directions in the field of adaptive explainable AI.
10. **Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives**: Encouraging discussions that bring together insights from different disciplines, such as psychology, design, computer science, and ethics, to enrich the understanding of adaptive AI explanations.
